This repository represents the codes applied to generate all the data in the article : [Dynamic Path Planning Based on Neural Networks for Aerial Inspection](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40313-022-00941-y)

Fell free to play with the codes and create new simulations or to compare with other path planning aprouches.

The simulations were generated using PX4-ROS/Kinect package and gazebo7.
